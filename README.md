# mfmodeling
Multi-fidelity modeling using Gaussian process regression

### Purpose of this project
This project is motivated to apply multi-fidelity data fusion algorithms to the regression problem in turbulent transport modeling in magnetic fusion plasma.

The developed module `mfmodeling.py` will be available as a general tool for multi-fidelity regression problems.
